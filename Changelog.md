## 0.5.0 (unreleased)

- Show emoji presentation in Unicode properties query tool.

## 0.4.0 (2023-11-27)

- Fix UTF-8 decoding of incomplete UTF-8 multibyte sequences to properly report `Invalid`.
- Change signature of `inline from_utf8(string_view const&)` slightly by dropping its cref.
- Move `scan_result.next` to `scan_state.next`.

## 0.3.0 (2023-03-01)

- Fixes build error on GCC 13.
- Fixes properly stopping at control characters in complex sub-state in scan API.
- Fixes successful processing invalid UTF-8 in scan API.
- Fixes installing missing headers for use of this API as non-embedded library.
- Changes project and include directory from `unicode` to `libunicode` to avoid include path conflict with `ICU`.
- Adds compile time option to either build static or dynamic binaries (`LIBUNICODE_BUILD_STATIC`).
- Adds SONAME version to libraries.

## 0.2.1 (2023-02-14)

- Fixes unicode-query's output for "character width".
- Fixes decoding invalid UTF-8 locking up.
- Fixes stage1 multistage-table sizes, reducing memory footprint a bit.
- Adds SIMD implementation for scan API on ARM64 (NEON).
- unicode-query is now linked statically on UNIX platforms.

## 0.2.0 (2022-11-13)

- Slightly improve performance of grapheme cluster segmentation.
- Fixes grapheme cluster segmentation of multiple consecutive regional flags.
- Add access to Age property of a codepoint (giving information about at which Unicode version a codepoint was introduced).
- Add access to the assigned name of a codepoint.
- unicode-query: Now also prints name and age properties.
- CMake install target also installs header and library (not just tools).
- Reduce number of dependencies down to fmtlib and (for unit tests) Catch2.
- Enables libunicode to be found via CMake's `find_package()`.
- Improved default installation directories on UNIX via GNUInstallDirs helper.
- Enable compiling on ARM64.

## 0.1.0 (2022-11-03)

While version 0.1.0 sounds like a small number, this project is out there since quite some years already
and actively used by Contour Terminal.

The biggest movements lately are major performance improvements in accessing Unicode properties,
fixing bugs as usual, and apart from being a modern C++ Unicode library, we've now also added
a command line tool to query Unicode properties in the hope it'll be useful to you.
